class FirstCode

//Java says everything should be in calss
//class name should be same as the file it is a standard approach (it can be differen also)

	//main () method is a default method in java, 
	//here it takes an argument as String a[] (array), 
	//it returns null value so 'void', 
	//methods are 2 types static (belongs to class) & non-static (belongs to object), 
	//access from every where so we added "public"
	{
		System.out.print("Hello!!"); //"print" is a method belongs to "out" object and out belongs to "System" calss.
